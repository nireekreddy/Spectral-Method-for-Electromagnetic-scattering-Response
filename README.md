# Surface Second-Harmonic Generation

Numerical methods in Electromagnetic response
Codes for the Spectral decomposition method based on electrodynamic analogue of the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation studying surface second harmonic generation from metals <https://opg.optica.org/josab/abstract.cfm?uri=josab-34-9-1824>

The codes also include Mie Scattering for cylinders.
